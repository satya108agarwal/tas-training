# CredHub Demo



Securing credentials in a Spring Boot microservices application, especially when deploying to platforms like Tanzu Platform Pivotal Cloud Foundry (TPPCF) using CredHub, is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information such as database passwords, API keys, and other credentials. Here's why it's important and how it can be achieved:

## Importance of Securing Credentials

**Protection Against Unauthorized Access:** Credentials, if exposed, can lead to unauthorized access to critical resources, compromising the entire application and potentially exposing user data.

**Compliance Requirements:** Many industries and regions have strict compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) regarding data protection. Secure credential management helps meet these standards.

**Platform Security:** Platforms like PCF provide robust security features, including CredHub, which enhances security by storing and managing credentials securely, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
